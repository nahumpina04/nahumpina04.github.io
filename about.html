			<h1>So, you want to learn more about me?</h1>
			<img src="img/me-pic1.jpg" id="pic1" height="400px" widht="300px">
			<p>
				I am Nahum Piña, a Mexican-American Computer Science student at CBU. Some things about me are:
				<ul id="quick-facts">
					<li>I've lived in the Hemet and San Jacinto area my entire life</li>
					<li>I enjoy watching soccer and football &#40;my favorite teams are Club America and the Steelers&#41;</li>
					<li>I am a first generation student</li>
					<li>I travel to Mexico at least once a year</li>
				</ul>

				I attended Hemet High School and graduated as class salutatorian in 2022. Once I graduated, I began attending California Baptist University,
				where I attend now. My passion for computer science came from my dad, who always worked with computers when I was young. As I grew up, I would
				use technology and learn how to use it. It was then that I decided that I wanted to work in a related field. I choose CBU because of the faith
				integration within the classes as well as the academic rigor this place provides. I plan on graduating spring 2025 and work as a back-end devloper
				or a cyber security analyst.

				I've been involved in several projects. At the College of Engineering, I've been able to create robots,
				programming them using block code and C++. A notable project is the Biofeedback Glove. In this project,
				I was given a robotic arm and tasked with creating a glove, circuit, and program to interconnect all of the
				tasks and make the given arm move, repsoding to the glove. In my group, I was tasked to complete the programming.
				I created an simple program that would begin with a calibration phase to adapt the movements as close to the 
				user's hand as possible. The program would then continuously read changes in the glove and output them to the arm.
				Due to malfuntioning sensors, the arm didn't work adequately. However, when testing with fully functioning sensors,
				the arm was able to move accordingly.

				Other projects that are currently in the works are:
				<ul id="projects">
					<li>Loteria Now
						<p>- An addition to the classic Mexican board game that reads the cards to players, allowing everyone to play</p>
					</li>
					<li>XML Bible Viewer
						<p>- Simple web interface that allows users to input their XML bibles, or provided bibles, and read</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Websites<p>- Hand-coded websites, like this one, made for personal and business use</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
